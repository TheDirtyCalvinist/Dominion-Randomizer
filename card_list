Card: Adventurer
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 6
Text: Reveal cards from your deck until you reveal 2 Treasure cards. Put those Treasure cards into your hand and discard the other revealed cards.
Rules Clarification: If you have to shuffle in the middle, shuffle. Don't shuffle in the revealed cards as these cards do not go to the Discard pile until you have finished revealing cards. If you run out of cards after shuffling and still only have one Treasure, you get just that one Treasure.

Card: Alchemist
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 3+1P
Text: +2 Cards, +1 Action. When you discard this from play, you may put this on top of your deck if you have a Potion in play.
Rules Clarification: When you play this, you draw two cards and may play an additional Action card this turn. In the Clean-up Phase, then you discard this, if you have at least one Potion card in play, you may put Alchemist on top of your deck. This is optional and happens before drawing your new hand. If you have no cards in your deck when you do this, Alchemist becomes the only card in your deck. If you have multiple Alchemists and a Potion, you can put any or all of the Alchemists on top of your deck. You don't have to have used the Potion to buy anything, you only need to have played it.

Card: Ambassador
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 3
Text: Reveal a card from your hand. Return up to 2 copies of it from your hand to the Supply. Then each other player gains a copy of it.
Rules Clarification: First you choose and reveal a card from your hand. You may place up to 2 copies of that card from your hand back in the Supply. You may choose not to put any of them back in the Supply. Then the other players each gain a copy of it from the Supply. If the pile for the chosen card runs out, some players may not get one; cards are given out in turn order starting with the next player. If you have no other cards in hand when you play this, it does nothing.

Card: Apothecary
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 2+1P
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Reveal the top 4 cards of your deck. Put the revealed Coppers and Potions into your hand. Put the other cards back on top of your deck in any order.
Rules Clarification: You draw a card first. Then reveal the top four cards, put the Coppers and Potions into your hand, and put the rest back on top of your deck. If there aren't four cards left in your deck, reveal what you can and shuffle to get the rest. If there still  aren't enough cards, just reveal what there is. Any cards that are not Copper and are not Potion go back on top of your deck in an order you choose. You cannot choose not to take all of the Coppers and Potions. If after revealing four cards there are no cards left in your deck, the cards you put back will become the only cards in your deck.

Card: Apprentice
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 5
Text: +1 Action. Trash a card from your hand. +1 Card per Coin it costs. +2 Cards if it has Potion in its cost.
Rules Clarification: If you do not have any cards left in hand to trash, you do not draw any cards. If you trash a card costing 0, such as Curse or Copper, you do not draw any cards. Otherwise you draw a card per Coin the card you trashed cost, and another two cards if it had Potion in its cost. For example, if you trash a Golem, which costs Potion and 4 Coin, you draw 6 cards.

Card: Bag of Gold
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action - Prize Cost: 0 *
Text: +1 Action. Gain a Gold, putting it on top of your deck. (This is not in the Supply)
Rules Clarification: The Gold you gain comes from the Supply and is put on top of your deck. If your deck has no cards in it, it becomes the only card in your deck. If there are no Golds left in the Supply, you do not gain one.

Card: Bank
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure Cost: 7
Text: When you play this, it’s worth 1 Coin per Treasure card you have in play (counting this).
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth a variable amount. When you play Bank, it is worth 1 Coin per Treasure you have in play, counting itself. Remember, you choose what order to play Treasure cards. If you play Bank with no other Treasures in play, it is worth 1 Coin. If you play two copies of Bank in a row, the one you play second will be worth 1 Coin more than the first one. Bank produces money right when you play it; things that happen later in the turn will not change how much money you got from it.

Card: Baron
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 4
Text: +1 Buy. You may discard an estate card. If you do, +4 Coin. Otherwise, gain an estate card.
Rules Clarification: You are never obligated to discard an Estate, even if you have one in your hand. However, if you do not discard an Estate, you must gain an Estate (if there are any left); you cannot choose to just get +1 Buy from this card.

Card: Bazaar
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 5
Text: +1 Card, +2 Actions, +1 Coin.
Rules Clarification: You draw a card, get 2 more Actions to use, and get 1 more coin to spend this turn.

Card: Bishop
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: +1 Coin, +1 VP. Trash a card from your hand. +VP equal to half its cost in coins, rounded down. Each other player may trash a card from his hand.
Rules Clarification: Trashing a card is optional for the other players but mandatory for you. If players care about the order things happen for this, you trash a card first, then each other player may trash a card, in turn order. Only the player who played Bishop can get VP tokens from it. Potions in costs is ignored, for example if you trash Golem (from Dominion: Alchemy), which costs 4 Coins and a Potion, you get 3 VP total (counting the 1 VP you always get from Bishop). If you have no cards left in hand to trash, you still get the 1 Coin and 1 VP.

Card: Black Market
Set: Promo Type: Action
Cost: 3
Text: +2 Coins. Reveal the top 3 cards of the Black Market deck. You may buy one of them immediately. Put the unbought cards on the bottom of the Black Market deck in any order. (Before the game, make a Black Market deck out of one copy of each Kingdom card not in the supply.)
Rules Clarification: Black Market allows you to Buy a card during the Action phase. You can use coins provided by other Action cards played earlier in the Action phase and you can also play Treasure cards from your hand to pay the cost of the bought card. The Treasure cards are played to the table in your play area, just as you would during the Buy phase. You may play more Treasure cards than are required for the purchase; the extra coins from Action cards and Treasure cards are available to use during your Buy phase. You may even play Treasure cards without Buying a card. You may not reuse coins already spent during a turn. A card bought during the Action phase does not count as a card bought in your Buy phase, so you do not need an action card giving you +1 Buy to still buy a card during your normal Buy phase. To use the Black Market Kingdom card, you must create a Black Market deck before starting the game. The Black Market deck is made up of Kingdom cards that are not in the Supply of the current game. The players should agree before the game which cards will be used to create the Black Market deck (for example, you could agree to use one of every Kingdom card you own that is not a part of the Supply). It is recommended that the Black Market deck contain at least 15 Kingdom cards, with no duplicates. All players can see which cards are placed in the Black Market deck before the game begins. Take one of each selected Kingdom card, shuffle them together, and place the deck face down on the table where all players can reach it. This deck is not a Supply pile and if it is emptied, it does not count towards the end game conditions. If you play Black Market and the Black Market deck is empty, you cannot buy a card but you still get +2 Coins. If you play Black Market and choose not to buy one of the three cards from the Black Market deck, you still get +2 Coins.

Card: Bridge
Set: Intrigue Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: +1 Buy, +1 Coin. All cards (including cards in players’ hands) cost 1 Coin less this turn, but no less than 0 Coin.
Rules Clarification: Costs are 1 coin lower for all purposes. For example, if you played Village, then Bridge, then Workshop, you could use Workshop to gain a Duchy (because Duchy now costs 4 coins due to the Bridge). Then if you played 3 coins, you could buy a Silver (for 2 coins) and an Estate (for 1 coin). Cards in players' decks are also affected. The effect is cumulative; if you Throne Room a Bridge, all cards will cost 2 coins less this turn. Costs never go below 0 coins. For this reason, if you play Bridge and then play Upgrade, you could trash a Copper (which still costs zero, even though you played Bridge) and gain a Pawn (which costs 1 after Bridge is played).

Card: Bureaucrat
Set: Basic
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 4 Text: Gain a Silver Card: put it on top of your deck. Each other player reveals a Victory card from his hand and puts it on his deck (or reveals a hand with no Victory cards)
Rules Clarification: If you have no cards left in your Deck when you play this card, the Silver you gain will become the only card in your Deck. Similarly, if another player has no cards in his Deck, the Victory card he puts on top will become the only card in his Deck.

Card: Caravan
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 4
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. At the start of your next turn, +1 Card.
Rules Clarification: Draw a card at the start of your next turn (not before); Caravan itself is discarded during the Clean-up phase of that subsequent turn.

Card: Cellar
Set: Basic Type: Action  Cost: 2 Text: +1 Action. Discard any number of cards. +1 Card per card discarded
Rules Clarification: You can't discard Cellar to itself, since it isn't in your hand any longer when you resolve it. You choose what cards to discard and discard them all at once. You only draw cards after you have discarded. If you have to shuffle to do the drawing, the discarded cards will end up shuffled into your new Deck.

Card: Chancellor
Set: Basic Type: Action  Cost: 3 Text: +2 Coins. You may immediately put your deck into your discard pile.
Rules Clarification: You must resolve the Chancellor (decide whether or not to discard your Deck by flipping it into your Discard pile) before doing other things on your turn, like deciding what to buy or playing another Action card. You may not look through your Deck as you discard it.

Card: Chapel
Set: Basic
Type: Action  Cost: 2 Text: Trash up to 4 cards from your hand.
Rules Clarification: You can't trash the Chapel itself since it isn't in your hand when you resolve it. You could trash a different Chapel card if that card were in your hand.

Card: City
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action  Cost: 5 Text: +1 Card, +2 Actions. If there are one or more empty Supply piles, +1 Card. If there are two or more, +1 Coin and +1 Buy.
Rules Clarification: You draw a card and can play two more Actions no matter what. If there is just one empty pile in the Supply, you also draw another card. If there are two or more empty piles, you both draw another card, and get 1 coin to spend and an extra Buy to use in the Buy phase. There are no further bonuses if three or more piles are empty. This only checks how many piles are empty when you play it; if piles become empty later in the turn, you do not go back and get the bonuses. If a pile stops being empty due to cards being returned to it, such as with the Dominion: Seaside card Ambassador, Cities played after that will not count that pile as empty. An empty trash pile does not count for this.

Card: Conspirator
Set: Intrigue Type: Action  Cost: 4 Text: +2 Coins. If you played 3 or more Actions this turn (counting this): +1 Card, +1 Action
Rules Clarification: You evaluate whether or not Conspirator gives you +1 Card and +1 Action when you play it. If later in the turn you play more Action cards, you do not go back and reevaluate a Conspirator played earlier. For the purposes of counting actions, if you Throne Room an Action, that's one Action for the Throne Room, one for the selected Action played the first time, and one for the selected Action played the second time. For example, if you play Throne Room on Conspirator, the first Conspirator will be your second Action, and won't give you +1 Card or +1 Action, but the second Conspirator will be your third Action, and you will get +1 Card and +1 Action for that second Conspirator. Action - Victory cards are Actions. 

Card: Contraband
Set: Prosperity Type: Treasure 
Cost: 5 Text: 3 Coin, +1 Buy. When you play this, the player to your left names a card. You can’t buy that card this turn.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 3 Coins, like Gold. When you play it, you get +1 Buy, the player to your left names a card, and you cannot buy the named card this turn. This does not stop you from gaining the card in ways other than buying it (such as via Hoard). He does not have to name a card in the Supply. If you play multiple Contrabands in one turn, the player to your left names a card each time; if he names different cards, you cannot buy any of the named cards this turn. You can play Treasures in any order, and you resolve this ability right when you play it, before playing any further Treasure cards. Note that once you buy a card in the Buy phase, you cannot play more Treasures. The number of cards left in a player's hand is public information; you can ask whenever you want to know it (for example, when that player plays Contraband).

Card: Coppersmith
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Copper produces an extra 1 Coin this turn.
Rules Clarification: This just changes how much money you get when playing Copper. The effect is cumulative; if you use Throne Room on Coppersmith, each Copper that you play that turn will produce 3 coins. 
Card: Council Room
Set: Basic Type: Action Cost: 5
Text: +4 Cards, +1 Buy. Each other player draws a card.
Rules Clarification: The other players must draw a card whether they want to or not. All players should shuffle as necessary.

Card: Counting House
Set: Prosperity Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: Look through your discard pile, reveal any number of Copper cards from it, and put them into your hand.
Rules Clarification: This card lets you look through your discard pile, something you normally are not allowed to do. You only get to look through your discard pile when you play this. You do not have to show the other players your entire discard pile, just the Coppers you take out. After you take out the Coppers, you can leave the cards in your discard pile in any order.
 Card: Courtyard
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 2 Text: +3 Cards. Put a card from your hand on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: You draw cards and add them to your hand before putting one back. The card you put on top of your deck can be any card in your new hand and doesn't have to be one of the 3 you just drew.

Card: Cutpurse
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 4
Text: +2 Coins. Each other player discards a Copper card (or reveals a hand with no Copper).
Rules Clarification: Other players must discard one and only one Copper. If they do not have a Copper, they must reveal their hand for all players to see.

Card: Diadem
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Treasure - Prize Cost: 0 *
Text: 2 Coins. When you play this, +1 Coin per unused Action you have (Action, not Action card). (This is not in the Supply)
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 2 Coins, like Silver. You play it in your Buy phase, like other Treasures. When you play it, you get an extra +1 Coin per unused Action you have. This means Actions, not Action cards. So for example if you play Farming Village (which gives you +2 Actions), then Diadem, Diadem will give you an extra +2 Coins, for 4 Coins total. If you play no Action cards at all on your turn, you will have one unused Action, so you will get 3 Coins total from Diadem.
 Card: Duke
Set: Intrigue Type: Victory Cost: 5 Text: Worth 1 VP for each Duchy you have.
Rules Clarification: This does nothing until the end of the game, at which time it's worth 1 VP per Duchy you have. This counts all of your cards - your Discard pile and hand are part of your Deck at that point. During set-up, place 12 Dukes in the Supply for a 3- or 4- player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.

Card: Embargo
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 2
Text: +2 Coins. Trash this card. Put an Embargo token on top of a Supply pile. When a player buys a card, he gains a Curse card per Embargo token on that pile.
Rules Clarification: You can pick any pile in the supply. If multiple Embargo cards are used to put Embargo tokens on the same pile, a player gains a Curse card for every Embargo token when they buy a card from that pile. You do not gain a Curse card if you gain a card from an Embargoed pile without buying it (for example, if you gain a card with Smugglers). If you Throne Room an Embargo, you place two Embargo tokens and they do not have to go on the same Supply pile. If you run out of Embargo tokens, use a suitable replacement to mark Embargoed piles. If there are no Curses left, Embargo tokens do nothing.

Card: Envoy
Set: Promo Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Reveal the top 5 cards of your deck. The player to the left chooses one for you to discard. Draw the rest.
Rules Clarification: If you do not have 5 cards in your deck, reveal as many as you can and shuffle your discard pile to reveal the rest. The player to your left then chooses one of the revealed cards for you to discard and then you draw the rest. If you do not have enough cards left to reveal 5 cards, even after shuffling, reveal as many as you can. The opponent to your left still discards one card before you draw the rest.

Card: Expand
Set: Prosperity Type: Action Cost: 7 Text: Trash a card from your hand. Gain a card costing up to 3 Coins more than the trashed card.
Rules Clarification: This is not in your hand after you play it, so you cannot trash it as the card trashed. The card you gain can cost up to 3 Coins more than the trashed card, but it can also cost any smaller amount, even less than the cost of the trashed card. You can trash a card and gain a copy of the same card. If you have no card in hand to trash, you do not gain a card. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile.

Card: Explorer
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 5
Text: You may reveal a Province card from your hand. If you do, gain a Gold card, putting it into your hand. Otherwise, gain a Silver card, putting it into your hand.
Rules Clarification: You don't have to reveal a Province if you have one. If you do reveal one you gain a Gold, otherwise you gain a Silver. The gained card comes from the supply and is put into your hand; it can be spent the same turn.

Card: Fairgrounds
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Victory
Cost: 6
Text: Worth 2 VP for every 5 differently named cards in your deck (rounded down).
Rules Clarification: At the end of the game, this is worth 2 VP per 5 differently named cards in your deck, rounded down. So if you have 0-4 different cards, it is worth 0 VP; if you have 5-9, it is worth 2 VP; if you have 10-14, it is worth 4 VP; if you have 15-19, it is worth 6 VP; and so on. By default there are only 17 differently named cards available in a game, but sometimes there may be more cards, such as via Young Witch's setup rule, or due to Tournament. Use 8 Fairgrounds in a game with 2 players, and 12 for a game with 3 or more players.

Card: Familiar
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 3+1P
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Each other player gains a Curse.
Rules Clarification: If there aren't enough Curses left to go around when you play Familiar, you deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to your left. If you play Familiar with no Curses remaining, you will still get +1 Card and +1 Action. A player gaining a Curse puts it face-up into his Discard pile.

Card: Farming Village
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action Cost: 4
Text: +2 Actions. Reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal an Action or Treasure card. Put that card into your hand and discard the other cards.
Rules Clarification: Reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal a Treasure or Action card. If you run out of cards before finding one, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards), and keep revealing cards. If you still cannot find one, just discard all of the revealed cards. If you do find a Treasure or Action card, put it into your hand, and discard the rest of the revealed cards. A card with multiple types, one of which is Treasure or Action (for example Diadem, a Treasure - Prize), is a Treasure or Action and so will be drawn by this. You do not choose Treasure or Action – you stop on the first card matching either type.

Card: Feast
Set: Basic Type: Action Cost: 4
Text: Trash this card. Gain a card costing up to 5 Coins.
Rules Clarification: The gained card goes into your Discard pile. It has to be a card from the Supply. You cannot use coins from Treasures or previous Actions (like the Market) to increase the cost of the card that you gain. If you use Throne Room on Feast, you will gain two cards, even though you can only trash Feast once. Gaining the card isn't contingent on trashing Feast; they're just two things that the card tries to make you do.

Card: Festival
Set: Basic
Type: Action
Cost: 5
Text: +2 Actions, +1 Buy, +2 Coins.
Rules Clarification: If you are playing multiple Festivals, keep a careful count of your Actions. Say how many you have left out loud; this trick works every time (i.e. "I'm playing the Festival and now have two Actions remaining. I play a Market and have two Actions remaining. I play another Festival and now have three Actions remaining….").

Card: Fishing Village
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 3
Text: +2 Actions, +1 Coin. At the start of your next turn: +1 Action, +1 Coin.
Rules Clarification: You get a coin to spend and 2 more Actions to use this turn. At the start of your next turn you get a coin and only one more Action. This means you will be able to play 2 Actions total on your next turn (counting your normal Action). Leave this in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn.

Card: Followers
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action – Attack - Prize Cost: 0 *
Text: Gain an Estate. Each other player gains a Curse and discards down to 3 cards in hand. (This is not in the Supply.) Rules Clarification: Do the things in the order listed. You draw 2 cards; then you gain an Estate from the Supply, putting it into your discard pile; then each other player gains a Curse from the Supply, putting it into his discard pile; then each other player discards down to 3 cards in hand. A player with 3 or fewer cards in hand does not discard any cards. If there are no Estates left, you do not gain one. If there are not enough Curses left, deal out the remaining Curses in turn order.

Card: Forge
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action
Cost: 7
Text: Trash any number of cards from your hand. Gain a card with cost exactly equal to the total cost in coins of the trashed cards.
Rules Clarification: "Any number" includes zero. If you trash no cards, you have to gain a card costing 0 Coin if you can. This is different from how cards like Expand work if you do not trash anything, because Forge looks at the total, not at any one card's cost. If there is no card at the required cost, you do not gain a card. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Potion symbols (on cards from Dominion: Alchemy) are not added, and the card you gain cannot have a Potion symbol in its cost.

Card: Fortune Teller
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 3
Text: +2 Coins. Each other player reveals cards from the top of his deck until he reveals a Victory or Curse card. He puts it on top and discards  the other revealed cards.
Rules Clarification: Each other player reveals cards from the top of his deck until he reveals a Victory or Curse card. If he runs out of cards before finding one, he shuffles his discard pile (but not the revealed cards), and keeps revealing cards. If he still cannot find one, he just discards all of the revealed cards. If he does find one, he puts the Victory or Curse card on top of his deck, and discards the other revealed cards. If his deck has no other cards in it, it becomes the only card in his deck. A card with multiple types, one of which is Victory (such as Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue), is a Victory card. You do not choose Victory or Curse - they stop on the first card that matches either type.

Card: Gardens
Set: Basic
Type: Victory Cost: 4 Text: Worth 1 VP for every 10 cards in your deck (rounded down).
Rules Clarification: This Kingdom card is a Victory card, not an Action card. It does nothing until the end of the game, when it is worth 1 victory point per 10 cards in your Deck (counting all of your cards – your Discard pile and hand are part of your Deck at that point). Round down; if you have 39 cards, Gardens is worth 3 victory points. During set-up, place 12 Gardens in the Supply for a 3 or 4 player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2 player game.

Card: Ghost Ship
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 5
Text: +2 Cards. Each other player with 4 or more cards in hand puts cards from his hand on top of his deck until he has 3 cards in his hand.
Rules Clarification: The other players choose which cards they put on their decks and in what order. This has no effect on another player who already has only 3 cards in hand. A player with no cards left in their deck does not shuffle; the cards put back become the only cards in their deck.

Card: Golem
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 4+1P
Text: Reveal cards from your deck until you reveal 2 Action cards other than Golem cards. Discard the other cards, then play the Action cards in either order.
Rules Clarification: Reveal cards from the top of your deck, one at a time, until you have revealed two Action cards that are not Golem. If you run out of cards before revealing two non-Golem Actions, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) and continue. If you run out and have no discard pile left either, you just get the Actions you found. Discard all of the revealed cards except for the non-Golem Actions you found. If you did not find any, you're done. If you found one, play it. If you found two, play them both, in either order. You cannot choose not to play one of them. These Action cards are not in your hand and so are unaffected by things that look for cards in your hand. For example, if one of them is Throne Room (from Dominion), you cannot use it on the other one.

Card: Goons
Set: Prosperity Type: Action - Attack 
Cost: 6
Text: +1 Buy, +2 Coins. Each other player discards down to 3 cards in hand. While this is in play, when you buy a card, +1 VP.
Rules Clarification: You get 1 VP for each card you buy, but do not get a VP for gaining a card some other way. Multiple copies of Goons are cumulative; if you have two Goons in play and buy a Silver, you get 2 VP. However if you King's Court a Goons, despite having played the card 3 times, there is still only one copy of it in play, so buying Silver would only get you 1 VP.

Card: Grand Market
Set: Prosperity Type: Action
Cost: 6
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action, +1 Buy, +2 Coins. You can’t buy this if you have any Copper in play.
Rules Clarification: You do not have to play all of the Treasures in your hand in your Buy phase. Coppers in your hand do not stop you from buying Grand Market - only Coppers in play do. Coppers that were in play earlier in the turn but are not anymore also don't stop you; if you have 11 Coppers in play and 2 Buys, you could buy a Mint, trash all of your played Treasures, and then buy a Grand Market. You can gain Grand Market other ways – for example with Expand - whether or not you have Coppers in play. Treasures other than Copper do not prevent you from buying Grand Market, even if they are worth 1 Coin (such as Loan).

Card: Great Hall
Set: Intrigue Type: Action - Victory Cost: 3 Text: +1 Card. +1 Action. 1 VP
Rules Clarification: This is both an Action card and a Victory card. When you play it, you draw a card and may play another Action. At the end of the game, it's worth 1 VP, like an Estate. During set-up, place 12 Great Halls in the Supply for a 3- or 4- player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.

Card: Hamlet
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action
Cost: 2
Text: +1 Card. +1 Action. You may discard a card; if you do +1 Action. You may discard a card; if you do +1 Buy.
Rules Clarification: First draw a card, and get +1 Action. Then you may either discard one card to get another +1 Action; or you may discard one card to get +1 Buy; or you may discard two cards and get both +1 Action and +1 Buy; or you may discard no cards at all. You only get the extra +1 Action or +1 Buy if you actually discarded a card for it. You cannot discard multiple cards to get multiple +Actions or multiple +Buys.
 Card: Harem
Set: Intrigue Type: Treasure - Victory Cost: 6 Text: 2 Coins, 2 VP
Rules Clarification: This is both a Treasure card and a Victory card. You can play it for 2 coins, just like a Silver card. At the end of the game, it's worth 2 VP . During set-up, place 12 Harems in the Supply for a 3- or 4-player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.

Card: Harvest
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action
Cost: 5
Text: Reveal the top 4 cards of your deck, then discard them. +1 Coin per differently named card revealed.
Rules Clarification: Reveal the top 4 cards of your deck. If there are not enough cards, reveal what you can, shuffle your discard pile, and reveal the rest. If there still are not 4 cards total to reveal, just reveal what you can. You discard the revealed cards, and get +1 Coin per differently named card revealed. For example if you revealed Copper, Silver, Copper, Estate, that would be +3 Coins.

Card: Haven
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 2
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Set aside a card from your hand face down. At the start of your next turn, put it into your hand.
Rules Clarification: First draw a card; then choose a card from your hand and set it aside, face down. Put the set aside card on the Haven, to remind you what it's for. Other players don't get to see what you put down. You have to set aside a card; it's not optional. Haven and the card stay there until the start of your next turn, at which point you put the set aside card into your hand. Haven itself is discarded during the Clean-up phase of that subsequent turn.

Card: Herbalist
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 2
Text: +1 Buy, +1 Coin. When you discard this from play, you may put one of your Treasures from play on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: When you play this, you get an extra coin to spend this turn, and may buy an additional card in your Buy phase. When you discard this from play (usually during Clean-up), you may choose a Treasure card you have in play, and put that card on your deck. If you have no cards in your deck, that Treasure will become the only card in your deck. You choose what order to discard cards during Clean-up; so, for example, if you have Herbalist, Potion, and Alchemist in play, you could choose to discard Alchemist first, putting it on top of your deck, then discard Herbalist, and put Potion on top of your deck. If you have multiple Herbalists in play, each one will let you put another Treasure from play onto your deck when you discard it.

Card: Hoard
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure
Cost: 6
Text: 2 Coins. While this is in play, when you buy a Victory card, gain a Gold.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 2 Coins, like Silver. When you buy a Victory card with this in play, you gain a Gold card from the Supply, putting it into your discard pile. If there are no Golds left, you do not get one. If you have multiple Hoards in play, you will gain multiple Golds from buying a single Victory card. If you buy multiple Victory cards, you will get Gold for each one. So for example if you had two Hoards in play and no other money, with +1 Buy, you could buy two Estates and gain four Golds. Victory cards include cards that are other types as well, such as Nobles and Harem in Dominion: Intrigue. You gain a Gold even if you use Watchtower to immediately trash the Victory card you gained. Victory cards gained other than by buying them do not get you Gold.

Card: Horn of Plenty
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Treasure
Cost: 5
Text: 0 Coin. When you play this, gain a card costing up to 1 Coin per differently named card you have in play, counting this. If it’s a Victory card, trash this.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 0 Coin. You play it in your Buy phase, like other Treasures. It does not produce any coins to spend. However, when you play it, you gain a card costing up to 1 Coin per differently named card you have in play. This includes itself, other played Treasures, played Actions, and any Duration cards (from Dominion: Seaside) played on your previous turn. It only counts cards currently in play, not ones that were in play but left; for example if you played a Feast (from Dominion) this turn, you will have trashed it, so it will not count for Horn of Plenty. The card you gain must come from the Supply, and is put into your discard pile. If it is a Victory card, trash Horn of Plenty. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Victory (such as Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue) are Victory cards. You do not have to play Horn of Plenty in your Buy phase, and you choose the order that you play Treasures. You do not trash Horn of Plenty if you gain a Victory card some other way while it's in play (such as by buying one).

Card: Horse Traders
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action - Reaction Cost: 4
Text: +1 Buy, +3 Coins. Discard 2 Cards.
Reaction: When another player plays an Attack card, you may set this aside from your hand. If you do, then at the start of your next turn, +1 Card and return this to your hand.
Rules Clarification: When you play this, you get +1 Buy and +3 Coins, and discard 2 cards from your hand. If you do not have enough cards to discard, just discard what you can; you still get the +1 Buy and +3 Coins. When another player plays an Attack card, before that card does anything, you may reveal this from your hand. If you do, you set it aside, and at the start of your next turn, you return it to your hand and draw a card. While it is set aside, it is not in play or in your hand, and cannot be further revealed to Attacks. Therefore it will only work on one Attack per round of turns. You can reveal it for an Attack and still play it on your next turn. You can reveal multiple Horse Traders to a single Attack. For example, if another player plays Followers, you could reveal and set aside two Horse Traders from your hand, then gain a Curse but discard no cards, as you would only have three cards in hand at that point. Then on your next turn you would pick up the two Horse Traders and also draw two cards.

Card: Hunting Party
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action
Cost: 5
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Reveal your hand. Reveal cards from your deck until you reveal a card that isn’t a duplicate of one in your hand. Put it into your hand and discard the rest.
Rules Clarification: First you draw a card and get +1 Action. Then you reveal your hand, and reveal cards from your deck until revealing one that is not a duplicate of one in your hand. A card is not a duplicate of one in your hand if it does not have the same name as any cards in your hand. If you run out of cards while revealing cards, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) and keep revealing cards. If you still do not find one, just discard all of the cards revealed from your deck. If you do find a card not matching any cards in your hand, put it into your hand and discard the other cards revealed from your deck.

Card: Ironworks
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Gain a card costing up to 4 Coins. If it is an… Action card, +1 Action. Treasure card, +1 Coin. Victory card, +1 Card.
Rules Clarification: The card you gain must be from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. You get a bonus depending on what type of card you gained. A card with 2 types gives you both bonuses; if you use Ironworks to gain a Great Hall, you will then draw a card (because Great Hall is a Victory card) and may play another Action (because Great Hall is an Action card). Costs of cards are affected by Bridge.

Card: Island
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Victory
Cost: 4
Text: Set aside this and another card from your hand. Return them to your deck at the end of the game. 2 VP
Rules Clarification: When you first take this card, take an Island player mat. Island is both an Action card and a Victory card. In a 3 or 4 player game, use 12 Islands. Use 8 Islands in a 2 player game. Island and the card set aside with it are set aside face up on the Island player mat provided. They should not be shuffled back into your deck when you shuffle your discard pile. They are returned to your deck at the end of the game in order to calculate total victory points. Island is worth 2 VP. If you have no other cards in hand when you play Island, just set Island aside by itself. If you Throne Room an Island, set aside the Island and a card from your hand, then set aside another card from your hand. You may look through the cards on your Island playing mat (they are face up) and other players may ask to see what you have there as well.

Card: Jester
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 5
Text: +2 Coins. Each other player discards the top card of his deck. If it’s a Victory card he gains a Curse. Otherwise he gains a copy of the discarded card or you do, your choice.
Rules Clarification: Each player with no cards in his deck shuffles his discard pile in order to get a card to discard. If he still has no cards, he does not discard one. For each player who discarded a card, if it is a Victory card, he gains a Curse, and otherwise, you choose: either that player gains a copy of the card, or you do. The gained copies and Curses come from the Supply and are put into the discard piles of the players who gain them. If a card is revealed for which there are no copies in the Supply, no one gains a copy of it. This Attack hits other players in turn order, which can matter when some piles are low. A card with multiple types, one of which is Victory (such as Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue) is a Victory card.

Card: King’s Court
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action Cost: 7 Text: You may choose an Action card in your hand. Play it three times.
Rules Clarification: This is similar to Throne Room (from Dominion), but plays the Action three times rather than twice. You pick another Action card in your hand, play it, play it again, and play it a third time. This does not use up any extra Actions you were allowed to play due to cards like Worker's Village - King's Court itself uses up one Action and that is it. You cannot play any other cards in between resolving the King's Court-ed Action card multiple times, unless that Action card specifically tells you to (such as King's Court itself does). If you King's Court a King's Court, you will play three different Actions after that, playing each one of them three times you do not play one Action nine times. If you King's Court a card that gives you +1 Action, such as Grand Market, you will end up with 3 Actions left afterwards, not the 1 Action you would have if you just played three Grand Markets.

Card: Laboratory
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: +2 Cards, +1 Action
Rules Clarification: Draw two cards. You may play another Action card during your Action phase.

Card: Library
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: Draw until you have 7 cards in hand. You may set aside any Action cards drawn this way, as you draw them; discard the set aside cards after you finish drawing.
Rules Clarification: If you have to shuffle in the middle, the set-aside cards are not shuffled into the new Deck. They will be discarded when you have finished drawing cards. If you run out of cards even after shuffling, you just get however many there were. You are not obligated to set aside Actions – you just have the option to do so. If you have 7 or more cards in hand after you play the Library, you don't draw any cards.

Card: Lighthouse
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 2
Text: + 1 Action. Now and at the start of your next turn: +1 Coin. While this is in play, when another player plays an Attack card, it doesn’t affect you.
Rules Clarification: You get an action and a coin this turn, but only a coin next turn. Attack cards played by other players don’t affect you, even if you want them to. You could reveal Secret Chamber in order to draw 2 cards and put 2 cards from your hand back on top of your deck when an Attack card is played, and you will still not suffer from the Attack card. You do still gain the benefits (like + Cards) of Attack cards you play on your turn. Lighthouse is discarded during the Clean-up phase of your next turn.

Card: Loan
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure
Cost: 3
Text: 1 Coin. When you play this, reveal cards from your deck until you reveal a Treasure. Discard it or trash it. Discard the other cards.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 1 Coin, like Copper. When you play it, you reveal cards from the top of your deck until revealing a Treasure card, and then you decide whether to trash that card or discard it. Then you discard all of the other revealed cards. If you run out of cards before revealing a Treasure, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) to get more; if you still do not find a Treasure, just discard all of the revealed cards. Remember that you can play Treasures in any order in the Buy phase and can choose not to play some of your Treasures if you want.

Card: Lookout
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 3
Text: +1 Action. Look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Trash one of them. Discard one of them. Put the other one on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: If you do not have 3 cards to look at from the top of your deck, look at as many as you can and then shuffle your discard pile to look at the remaining cards. You should look at all 3 cards before deciding which card to trash, which card to discard, and which card to put back on top of your deck. If the 3 cards you look at are the last 3 cards in your deck, the card you put back on top of your deck will be the only card left in your deck. If you have less than 3 cards to look at, even after shuffling, then you must follow the instructions on the card in order. If you only have one card to look at, you must trash it. If you have 2 cards to look at, you must trash one and discard one.

Card: Market
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 5
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action, +1 Buy, +1 Coin
Rules Clarification: Draw a card. You may play another Action card during your Action phase. During your Buy phase, you may buy an additional card from the supply, and add one coin to the total value of the Treasure cards played.  Card: Masquerade
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 3 Text: +2 Cards. Each player passes a card from his hand to the left at once. Then you may trash a card from your hand.
Rules Clarification: First you draw 2 cards. Next, each player (all at the same time) chooses a card from his hand and places it face down on the table between him and the player to his left. The player to the left then puts that card into his hand. Cards are passed simultaneously, so you may not look at the card you are receiving until you have chosen a card to pass. Finally, you may trash a card from your hand. Only the player who played Masquerade may trash a card. This is not an Attack and cannot be responded to with Moat or Secret Chamber.

Card: Menagerie
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action
Cost: 3
Text: +1 Action. Reveal your hand. If there are no duplicate cards in it, +3 Cards. Otherwise, +1 Card.
Rules Clarification: If there are any two or more cards in your hand with the same name, you only draw one card; if there are no matches, you draw three cards. Only the card names matter for this; Copper and Silver are different cards for example, despite both being Treasures. If you have no cards in hand at all after playing Menagerie, then you have no matching cards, and so get +3 Cards.

Card: Merchant Ship
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 5
Text: Now and at the start of your next turn: +2 Coins.
Rules Clarification: You get 2 coins to spend this turn, and 2 more on your next turn. Leave this in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn.

Card: Militia
Set: Basic
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 4 Text: +2 Coins. Each other player discards down to 3 cards in his hand.
Rules Clarification: The attacked players discard cards until they have only 3 cards in hand. Players who had 3 or fewer cards in hand when Militia was played do not discard any cards.

Card: Mine
Set: Basic Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: Trash a Treasure card from your hand. Gain a Treasure card costing up to 3 coin more; put it into your hand.
Rules Clarification: Generally, you can trash a Copper card and gain a Silver, or trash a Silver card and gain a Gold. However, you could also trash a Treasure to gain the same Treasure or a cheaper one. The gained card goes in your hand; thus, you can spend it the same turn. If you don't have a Treasure card in your hand to trash, you can’t gain anything.

Card: Mining Village
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: +1 Card, +2 Actions. You may trash this card immediately, If you do, +2 Coins.
Rules Clarification: You must decide whether to trash Mining Village or not before moving on to other actions or other phases. You get a card and +2 Actions, whether you choose to trash it or not. If you trash it you also get +2 Coins. If you Throne Room a Mining Village, you cannot trash Mining Village twice. You will get +1 Card, +2 Actions, and +2 Coins the first time you play it and trash it and when you play it the second time with the Throne Room you get +1 Card and +2 Actions but cannot trash it again.

Card: Minion
Set: Intrigue Type: Action - Attack Cost: 5 Text: 1 Action. Choose one: +2 Coins; or discard your hand, + 4 cards, and each other player with at least 5 cards in hand discards his hand and draws 4 cards.
Rules Clarification: You get +1 Action whichever option you choose. The options are +2 coins, or everything after that - discarding, drawing 4 cards, and other players discarding and drawing. A player who Moats this neither discards nor draws. Other players are only affected by this if they have 5 or more cards in hand. Other players can use Secret Chamber when you play Minion even if they do not have 5 or more cards in hand.

Card: Mint
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: You may reveal a Treasure card from your hand. Gain a copy of it. then you buy this, trash all Treasures you have in play.
Rules Clarification: When you buy this, you trash all of your Treasure cards in play. You do not trash Treasure cards in your hand or elsewhere; just the ones in play, if any. If you buy multiple cards in a turn, trash your Treasures right when you buy Mint; you still have any leftover coins they produced for spending on something else. Remember you do not have to play all of the Treasures from your hand each turn (just all the ones you want producing money for you). You do not get additional chances to play Treasure cards between buys in the Buy phase; first you play Treasures, then you buy cards. When you play Mint, you reveal a Treasure card from your hand and gain a copy of it from the Supply. The gained card goes into your discard pile. The revealed card stays in your hand. The Treasure card can also have other types, like Harem (from Dominion: Intrigue). If you buy a Mint and use Watchtower to put it on top of your deck or trash it, you still trash all of your Treasures from play. However, if you buy a Mint with Royal Seal in play, the Royal Seal will be gone before you can use it to put Mint on your deck.

Card: Moat
Set: Basic
Type: Action - Reaction Cost: 2 Text: +2 Cards
Reaction: When another player plays an Attack card, you may reveal this from your hand. If you do, you are unaffected by that attack.
Rules Clarification: An Attack card is one that says "Attack" on the bottom line (usually, "Action - Attack"). When someone else plays an Attack card, you may reveal the Moat by showing it from your hand to the other players and then returning it to your hand (before the Attack card resolves). You are then unaffected by that Attack card. You won't gain a Curse because of a Witch or reveal a card to a Spy, and so on. It's just like you aren't in the game for purposes of resolving that Attack. Moat doesn't stop anything an Attack does to other players or to the player of the Attack; for example, if everyone else Moats a Witch, the person who played it still gets to draw 2 cards. Moat can also be played on your turn as an Action to draw 2 cards.

Card: Moneylender
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Trash a Copper card from your hand. If you do, +3 coins.
Rules Clarification: If you do not have a Copper in your hand to trash, you don't get the +3 coins to spend in the Buy phase.

Card: Monument
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: +2 Coins, +1 VP

Card: Mountebank
Set: Prosperity 
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 5
Text: +2 Coins. Each other player may discard a Curse. If he doesn’t, he gains a Curse and a Copper. 
Rules Clarification: This hits the other players in turn order when that matters (such as when the Curse or Copper pile is low). Each of the other players in turn chooses whether or not to discard a Curse card from his hand, and if he does not, gains a Curse and a Copper from the Supply, putting them into his discard pile. If either the Curse or Copper pile is empty, he still gains the other one. If both are empty, he does not gain either, but can still discard a Curse if he wants to. A player using Moat (from Dominion) on this may not discard a Curse, and doesn't gain a Curse or Copper – you cannot Moat just part of the attack. A player using Watchtower on this can use it just to trash the Curse, just to trash the Copper, or to trash both.

Card: Native Village
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 2
Text: +2 Actions Choose one: Set aside the top card of your deck face down on your Native Village mat; or put all the cards from your mat into your hand. You may look at the cards on your mat at any time; return them to your deck at the end of the game.
Rules Clarification: When you first gain one of these, take a Native Village player mat to put cards from this on. When you play Native Village, either take all of the set aside cards from your Native Village player mat and put them into your hand, or set aside the top card of your deck face down (shuffling first if needed) on the Native Village player mat. You may choose either option even if you have no cards on your mat or no cards in your deck. You may look at the cards on your Native Village player mat at any time. At the end of the game, any cards still on your mat return to your deck for scoring. Native Village itself does not get set aside; it goes to your discard pile during the Clean-up phase.

Card: Navigator
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: +2 Coins. Look at the top 5 cards of your deck. Either discard all of them, or put them back on top of your deck in any order.
Rules Clarification: You discard all 5 cards or none of them. If you don't discard them, put them back in any order. If there aren't 5 cards left in your deck, look at as many as you can, then shuffle your discard pile (not including the cards you are currently looking at),and look at the rest. If there still aren't 5, you just look at however many are left, and put them back or discard them.

Card: Nobles
Set: Intrigue Type: Action - Victory Cost: 6 Text: Choose 1: +3 Cards; or +2 Actions,   2 VP
Rules Clarification: This is both an Action card and a Victory card. When you play it, you choose either to draw 3 cards or to get 2 more Actions to use; you cannot mix and match. At the end of the game, this is worth 2 VP. During set-up, place 12 Nobles in the Supply for a 3- or 4-player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.

Card: Outpost
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 5
Text: You only draw 3 cards (instead of 5) in this turn’s Clean-up phase. Take an extra turn after this one. This can’t cause you to take more than two consecutive turns.
Rules Clarification: The extra turn is completely normal except that your starting hand for it is only 3 cards. This means that you only drew 3 cards instead of 5 cards during the Clean-up phase of the turn when you played Outpost. Leave Outpost in front of you until the end of the extra turn. If you play Outpost as well as a "Now and at the start of your next turn" card, such as Merchant Ship, the turn from Outpost will be that next turn, so you'll get those coins then. If you manage to play Outpost twice in one turn, you will still only get one extra turn. If you play Outpost during an extra turn, it won't give you another turn.
 Card: Pawn
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 2 Text: Choose two: +1 Card, +1 Action, +1 Buy, +1 Coin. (The choices must be different)
Rules Clarification: First pick any 2 of the 4 options. You cannot pick the same option twice. After picking both, do both, in either order. You may not choose to draw a card, look at the card drawn, and then make your second choice.

Card: Pearl Diver
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 2
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Look at the bottom card of your deck. You may put it on top.
Rules Clarification: Draw a card before you look at the bottom card of your deck. If placing the card on top of your deck, be sure not to look at the next card on the bottom of your deck while moving the card. If you have no cards left when it's time to look at the bottom, you shuffle first.

Card: Peddler
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action
Cost: 8
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action, +1 Coin. During your Buy phase, this costs 2 Coins less per Action card you have in play, but not less than 0 Coin.
Rules Clarification: Most of the time, this costs 8 Coins. During Buy phases, this costs 2 Coins less per Action card you have in play. This cost applies to all Peddler cards, including ones in hands and decks. It never costs less than 0 Coin. If you play King's Court on Worker's Village, for example, that is just two Action cards you have in play, even though you played the Worker's Village three times. Buying cards using the promotional card Black Market is something that does not happen during a Buy phase, so Peddler still costs 8 Coins then.

Card: Philosopher’s Stone
Set: Alchemy
Type: Treasure Cost: 3+1P
Text: When you play this, count your deck and discard pile. Worth 1 coin per 5 cards total between them (rounded down).
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure card. It is a Kingdom card; it will only be in games where it is randomly dealt out as one of the 10 Kingdom cards, or otherwise selected to be one of them. It is played during your Buy phase, like other Treasure cards. When you play it, count the number of cards in your deck and discard pile combined, divide by 5, and round down. That is how many coins this produces for you. Once played, the amount of coins you get does not change even if the number of cards changes later in the turn. The next time you play it, count again. If you play multiple copies, obviously the number will be the same for all of them. It does not matter what order your discard pile is in, but the order your deck is in matters. Do not change that order while counting! You will get to look through your discard pile as you count it. You only count your deck and discard pile, not your hand or cards in play or set aside cards. You cannot play more Treasures after buying something in your buy phase; so for example you cannot buy a card, then play Philosopher's Stone, then buy another card.

Card: Pirate Ship
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 4
Text: Choose one: Each other player reveals the top 2 cards of his deck, trashes a revealed Treasure that you choose, discards the rest, and if anyone trashed a Treasure you take a Coin token; or, +1 Coin per Coin token you’ve taken with Pirate Ships this game.
Rules Clarification: When you first take this card, take a Pirate Ship player mat. If you use the Pirate Ship to trash treasures, a player with just one card left reveals that last card and then shuffles to get the other card to reveal (without including the revealed card); a player with no cards left shuffles to get both of them. A player who still doesn't have two cards to reveal after shuffling just reveals what he can. Each player trashes one Treasure card at most, of the attacker's choice from the two revealed cards. As long as you trashed at least one Treasure card in this way, place a Coin token on your Pirate Ship player mat. You can't get more than one Coin token each time you play Pirate Ship, no matter how many treasures it trashes. If you choose not to try to trash treasures from the other players, the Pirate Ship is worth one coin for each Coin token on your Pirate Ship player mat. The Coin tokens are cumulative, so after you have used your Pirate Ships to trash coins 3 times (and you trash at least one Treasure card each time), any Pirate Ship you play could be worth 3 coins. Pirate Ship is an Action-Attack and players can reveal Secret Chamber even if you choose to use Pirate Ship for the coin value.

Card: Possession
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 6+1P
Text: The player to your left takes an extra turn after this one, in which you can see all cards he can and make all decisions for him. Any cards he would gain on that turn, you gain instead; any cards of his that are trashed are set aside and returned to his discard pile at the end of turn.
Rules Clarification: You are not taking a turn with the deck of the player to your left; that player is taking a turn, with you making the decisions and gaining the cards. This is a crucial difference to keep in mind when considering card interactions – the “you” in all cards still refers to the player being Possessed, not the player doing the Possessing. Possession has several pieces to it:
- You can see the Possessed player's cards for the entire turn, which means you will see his next hand during Clean-up. You will also see any cards he is entitled to see due to card rules; for example, you can look at cards he has set aside with Native Village (from Seaside). You can count any cards he can count.
- You make all decisions for the Possessed player, including what cards to play, decisions those cards provide, and what cards to buy.
- Any cards the Possessed player would have gained in any way, you gain instead; this includes cards bought, as well as cards gained due to Actions. The cards you gain this way go to your discard pile, even if they would have gone to that player's hand or the top of his deck or somewhere else. You only gain cards he would have; you do not gain tokens he would have (for example from the Dominion: Seaside card Pirate Ship).
- During the Possessed turn, whenever one of that player's cards is trashed, set it aside, and that player puts it into his discard pile at the end of the turn, after Clean-up. This counts as the card being trashed, so, for example, you could trash a Mining Village (from Dominion: Intrigue) and get the 2 Coins. Getting those cards back at end of turn does not count as those cards being gained (so for example, you won't get them). Other players' cards that are trashed during that turn are not returned.
- Cards passed with Masquerade (from Dominion: Intrigue) are not being gained or trashed, and so are passed normally. Cards returned to the Supply with Ambassador (from Dominion:
Seaside) are also not being trashed, and so return to the Supply normally.
- If you make another player play an Attack via Possession, that Attack will hit you like it would normally. If you want to use a Reaction in response to that Attack (such as Secret Chamber from Dominion: Intrigue), you would be the one revealing the Reaction, not the player being Possessed.
- Possession causes an extra turn to be played, like the card Outpost does (from Dominion: Seaside). The extra turn happens only after this turn is completely over - you will have discarded everything and drawn your next hand. Outpost only prevents itself from giving a player two consecutive turns, it does not prevent other cards or the rules from doing so. So, for example, if you play Possession in a two-player game, then after the Possession turn, that player still gets his normal turn. If he played Outpost during that turn though, it would not give him an extra turn. If you play both Outpost and Possession in the same turn, the Outpost turn happens first. If you make someone play Outpost during a turn in which you Possessed them, that player will get the extra turn and make decisions during it and so forth, not you; if you make someone play Possession during a turn in which you Possessed them, that will make that player Possess the player to his left, rather than you getting to Possess anyone further. Possession turns (and other extra turns) do not count for the tiebreaker. Once the game ends, no further turns are played, including extra turns from Possession and Outpost.
- Unlike Outpost, Possession is not a Duration card. It is discarded in the Clean-up phase of the turn you played it.
- Possession is cumulative; if you play it twice in one turn, there will be two extra turns after this one.

Card: Princess
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action - Prize
Cost: 0 *
Text: +1 Buy. While this is in play, cards cost $2 less, but not less than $0. (This is not in the Supply.)
Rules Clarification: This makes all cards cheaper (to a minimum of 0 Coin ) as long as it is in play. When it leaves play, it stops making cards cheaper. This applies to cards everywhere - cards in the Supply, cards in hand, cards in decks. For example if you played Princess, then Remake, trashing a Copper, you could gain a Silver, as Silver would cost 1 Coin while Copper would still cost 0 Coin. Using Throne Room (from Dominion) on Princess will not make cards cost 4 Coins less, as there is still only one copy of Princess in play. 
Card: Quarry
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure Cost: 4 Text: 1 Coin. While this is in play, Action cards cost 2 Coins less, but not less than 0 Coin.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 1 Coin, like Copper. While it is in play, Action cards cost 2 Coins less, to a minimum of 0 Coin. It is cumulative; if you play two Quarries during your Buy phase, then King's Court will only cost 3 Coins, rather than the usual 7 Coins. It affects the costs of cards that are Actions plus another type, such as Nobles (an Action - Victory card in Dominion: Intrigue). It is also cumulative with other effects that modify costs; if you play Worker's Village in your Action phase, then two Quarries in your Buy phase, Peddler will cost 2 Coins. It affects the costs of cards everywhere, such as cards in players' hands.

Card: Rabble
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 5 Text: +3 Cards. Each other player reveals the top 3 cards of his deck, discards the revealed Actions and Treasures, and puts the rest back on top in any order he chooses.
Rules Clarification: The other players shuffle if necessary to get 3 cards to reveal, and just reveal what they can if they still have fewer than 3 cards. They discard revealed Treasures and Actions and put the rest back on top in whatever order they want. Cards with more than one type match all of their types; for example if a player reveals Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue, it is an Action - Victory card, which means it is an Action, so he discards it.

Card: Remake
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: Do this twice: Trash a card from your hand then gain a card costing exactly 1 Coin more than the trashed card.
Rules Clarification: Trash a card from your hand, and gain a card costing exactly 1 Coin more than it; then trash another card from your hand, and gain a card costing exactly 1 Coin more than that card. If you have no cards in hand, you do not trash anything or gain anything; if you have only one card in hand, trash it and gain a card costing 1 Coin more than it. Gained cards come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. If there is no card at the exact cost needed, you do not gain a card for that trashed card. For example you could use Remake to trash an Estate, gaining a Silver, then trash a Copper, gaining nothing.

Card: Remodel
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Trash a card from your hand. Gain a card costing up to 2 Coins more than the trashed card.
Rules Clarification: You cannot trash the Remodel as it isn't in your hand when you resolve it (you can trash a different Remodel card from your hand). If you do not have a card to trash, you cannot gain a card from the Remodel. The gained card goes in your Discard pile. You can only gain cards from the Supply. The gained card need not cost exactly 2 coins more than the trashed card; it can cost that much or any amount less. You cannot use coins from Treasures or previous Actions (like the Market) to increase the cost of the card you gain. You can trash a card to gain a copy of the same card.

Card: Royal Seal
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure Cost: 5 Text: 2 Coins. While this is in play, when you gain a card, you may put that card on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 2 Coins, like Silver. If you gain multiple cards with this in play, this applies to each of them - you could put any or all of them on top of your deck. If you use this ability and there are no cards left in your deck, you do not shuffle; the card you gained becomes the only card in your deck. Royal Seal applies to all cards you gain while it is in play, whether bought or gained other ways. If you play the Dominion: Alchemy card Possession, and during the extra turn you have the possessed player play Royal Seal, he cannot put the card on his deck - he is not gaining the card, you are.
 Card: Saboteur
Set: Intrigue Type: Action - Attack Cost: 5 Text: Each other player reveals cards from the top of his deck until revealing one costing 3 Coins or more. He trashes that card and may gain a card costing at most 2 Coins less than it. He discards the other revealed cards.
Rules Clarification: Each other player turns over the top cards of his deck until he reveals one costing 3 coins or more. If a player needs to shuffle to continue revealing cards, he does not shuffle in the already revealed cards. If he goes through all of his cards without finding a card costing 3 coins or more, he just discards everything revealed and is done. If he does find a card costing 3 coins or more, he trashes it, and then may choose to gain a card costing at most 2 coins less than the trashed card. For example, if he trashed a card costing 5 coins, he may gain a card costing up to 3 coins. The gained card must be from the Supply and is put into his discard pile, as are his revealed cards. Costs of cards are affected by Bridge.

Card: Salvager
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: +1 Buy. Trash a card from your hand. + Coin equal to its cost.
Rules Clarification: If you have at least one card in your hand, then you must trash one. If you don't have a card in hand left to trash, you get no coins, but still get the +1 Buy.

Card: Scout
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Reveal the top 4 cards of your deck. Put the revealed Victory cards into your hand. Put the other cards on top your deck in any order.
Rules Clarification: If there are fewer than 4 cards left in your deck, reveal all the cards in your deck, shuffle your discard pile (which does not include currently revealed cards), and then reveal the remainder needed. Action - Victory cards are Victory cards. Curse cards are not Victory cards. Take all revealed Victory cards into your hand; you cannot choose to leave some on top. You do not have to reveal the order that you put cards back in.

Card: Scrying Pool
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 2+1P
Text: +1 Action. Each player (including you) reveals the top card of his deck and either discards it or puts it back, your choice. Then reveal cards from the top of your deck until revealing one that isn‘t an Action. Put all of your revealed cards into your hand.
Rules Clarification: First you reveal the top card of each player's deck, and either have them discard it or have them put it back. If people care about the order, go clockwise, starting with yourself. You make a separate decision for each player. After you finish making those decisions, reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal a card that isn't an Action card. If you run out of cards without revealing an non-Action card, shuffle your discard pile and keep going. If you have no discard pile left either, stop there. Put all of the revealed Action cards into your hand, plus that first non-Action you revealed. If the very first card you revealed was not an Action, that card goes into your hand. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action, are Actions. The only cards that go into your hand are the ones revealed as part of revealing cards until finding a non-Action; you do not get discarded cards from the first part of what Scrying Pool did, or cards from other players' decks.

Card: Sea Hag
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 4
Text: Each other player discards the top card of his deck, then gains a Curse card, putting it on top of his deck.
Rules Clarification: A player with no cards left in his deck shuffles first in order to get a card to discard. If he still has no cards, he doesn't discard one. A player discarding his last card to this has the gained Curse become the only card in his deck. If there aren't enough Curses left to go around, deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the player who played Sea Hag.
 Card: Secret Chamber
Set: Intrigue Type: Action - Reaction Cost: 2 Text: Discard any number of cards. +1 coin for per card discarded.
Reaction: When another player plays an Attack card, you may reveal this from your hand. If you do, +2 Cards, then put 2 cards from your hand on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: When you play this as an Action on your turn, you first discard any number of cards from your hand, then get 1 coin per card you discarded. You may choose to discard zero cards, but then you will get zero additional coins. The other ability does nothing at that time as it is only used as a Reaction. When someone else plays an Attack card, you may reveal Secret Chamber from your hand. If you do, first you draw 2 cards, then you put any 2 cards from your hand on top of your deck (in any order). The cards you put back do not have to be the ones you drew. You can put Secret Chamber itself on top of your deck; it's still in your hand when you reveal it. Revealing Secret Chamber happens prior to resolving what an Attack does to you. For example, if another player plays Thief, you can reveal Secret Chamber, draw 2 cards, put 2 back, and then you resolve getting hit by the Thief. You can reveal Secret Chamber whenever another player plays an Attack card, even if that Attack would not affect you. Also, you can reveal more than one Reaction card in response to an Attack. For example, after revealing the Secret Chamber in response to an Attack and resolving the effect of the Secret Chamber, you can still reveal a Moat to avoid the Attack completely.

Card: Shanty Town
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 3 Text: +2 Actions. Reveal your hand. If you have no actions cards in hand, +2 Cards.
Rules Clarification: You get 2 more Actions to use no matter what else happens. Then you must reveal your hand. If you have no Action cards in hand, you draw 2 cards. If the first card you draw is an Action card, you still draw the second card. Action – Victory cards are Action cards.

Card: Smithy
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: +3 Cards
Rules Clarification: Draw three cards.

Card: Smugglers
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 3
Text: Gain a copy of a card costing up to 6 Coins that the player to your right gained on his last turn.
Rules Clarification: This looks at the most recent turn of the player to your right, even if you've taken multiple turns in a row. If that player gained no cards, or nothing costing 6 or less, then Smugglers does nothing. If that player gained multiple cards costing 6 or less, you choose which one to gain a copy of. Gained cards must come from the supply. They can be any card gained, whether bought or otherwise gained; you can even gain a card that the previous player gained with Smugglers. If the previous player gained a card via Black Market, you will not be able to gain a copy of it, as there are no copies of it in the supply. This is not an Attack; Lighthouse and Moat can't stop it.

Card: Spy
Set: Basic
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 4 Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Each player (including you) reveals the top card of his deck and either discards it or puts it back, your choice.
Rules Clarification: Spy causes all players, including the one who played it, to reveal the top card of their Deck. Note that you draw your card for playing Spy before any cards are revealed. Anyone who does not have any cards left in their Deck shuffles in order to have something to reveal. Anyone who still has no cards to reveal doesn't reveal one. If players care about the order in which things happen for this, you do yourself first, then each other player in turn order. Revealed cards that aren't discarded are returned to the top of their players' Decks.

Card: Stash
Set: Promo
Type: Treasure Cost: 5 Text: 2 Coins. When you shuffle, you may put this anywhere in your deck.
Rules Clarification: Stash is a Treasure that produces 2 Coins when played, like Silver. Whenever you shuffle your deck, you can choose where in your deck each copy of Stash that you have in your deck goes. You can't look at the fronts of the other cards in your deck to see where to put it; Stash itself has a different card back, so that's how you'll know where it is. If you have multiple copies of Stash, you can clump them together or spread them out or whatever you want. Since Stash has a different card back, you will also know if it's in a player's hand, or set aside for someone's Haven (from Dominion: Seaside), and so on. 

Card: Steward
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 3 Text: Choose one: +2 cards; or +2 Coins; or trash 2 cards from your hand.
Rules Clarification: If you choose to trash 2 cards and have 2 or more cards in your hand after playing the Steward, then you must trash exactly 2 cards. You may choose to trash 2 cards, even if you only have 1 card left in your hand after playing the Steward; just trash the remaining card in your hand. You cannot mix and match - you either draw 2 cards, get 2 coins, or trash 2 cards.

Card: Swindler
Set: Intrigue Type: Action - Attack Cost: 3 Text: +2 Coins. Each other player trashes the top card of his deck and gains a card of the same cost that you choose.
Rules Clarification: A player with no cards left in his Deck shuffles first; a player who still has no cards does not trash a card or gain a card. If the order matters (such as when piles are running low), resolve Swindler in turn order starting with the player to your left. Gained cards go to discard piles. If a player trashes a 0-cost card such as Copper, you may choose to give him Curse (if there are any left). You can give a player another copy of the same card he trashed. The gained cards have to be ones from the Supply, and you have to pick a card that's left if you can (you cannot pick an empty pile). If there are no cards in the Supply with the same cost as a given player's trashed card, no card is gained by that player. A player who Moats this does not reveal a card from his deck, and so neither trashes a card nor gains a card.

Card: Tactician
Set: Seaside
Type: Action - Duration
Cost: 5
Text: Discard your hand. If you discarded any cards this way, then at the start of your next turn, +5 Cards, +1 Buy, and +1 Action.
Rules Clarification: You wait until the start of your next turn to draw the 5 extra cards; you don’t draw them at the end of the turn you played Tactician. Tactician stays out in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn. Because you must discard at least one card in order to gain the bonuses from Tactician, it is not possible to Throne Room a Tactician to get +10 cards, +2 Buys, and +2 Actions. You will have to discard all of your cards with the first Tactician and you will not have cards left in your hand to trigger the card drawing or the extra Buy or the extra Action when you play Tactician for the second time.

Card: Talisman
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure
Cost: 4
Text: While this is in play, when you buy a card costing 4 Coins or less that is not a
Victory card, gain a copy of it.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure worth 1 Coin like Copper. Each time you buy a non-Victory card costing 4 Coins or less with this in play, you gain another copy of the bought card. If there are no copies left, you do not gain one. The gained card comes from the Supply and goes into your discard pile. If you have multiple Talismans, you gain an additional copy for each one; if you buy multiple cards for 4 Coins or less, Talisman applies to each one. For example if you have two Talismans, four Coppers, and two Buys, you could buy Silver and Trade Route, gaining two more Silvers and two more Trade Routes. Talisman only affects buying cards; it does not work on cards gained other ways, such as with Expand. A card is a Victory card if Victory is any of its types; for example Great Hall from Dominion: Intrigue is an Action - Victory card, so it is a Victory card. Talisman only cares about the cost of the card when you buy it, not its normal cost; so for example it can get you a Peddler if you have played two Actions this turn, thus lowering Peddler’s cost to 4 Coins, or can get you a Grand Market if you played Quarry.

Card: Thief
Set: Basic
Type: Action - Attack Cost: 4 Text: Each other player reveals the top 2 cards of his deck. If they revealed ant Treasure cards, they trash one of them that you choose. You may gain any or all of these trashed cards. They discard the other revealed cards.
Rules Clarification: A player with just one card left reveals that last card and then shuffles to get the other card to reveal (without including the revealed card); a player with no cards left shuffles to get both of them. A player who still doesn't have two cards to reveal after shuffling just reveals what he can. Each player trashes one Treasure card at most, of the attacker's choice from the two revealed cards, and then you gain any of the trashed cards that you want. You can only take Treasures just trashed—not ones trashed on previous turns. You can take none of them, all of them, or anything in between. Put the Treasures you decided to gain into your Discard pile. The ones you choose not to gain stay in the trash pile.

Card: Throne Room
Set: Basic Type: Action Cost: 4 Text: Choose an Action card in your hand. Play it Twice.
Rules Clarification: You pick another Action card in your hand, play it, and play it again. The second use of the Action card doesn't use up any extra Actions you have. You completely resolve playing the Action the first time before playing it the second time. If you Throne Room a Throne Room, you play an Action, doing it twice, and then play another Action and do it twice; you do not resolve an Action four times. If you Throne Room a card that gives you +1 Action, such as Market, you will end up with 2 Actions left afterwards, which is tricky, because if you'd just played Market twice you'd only have 1 Action left afterwards. Remember to count the number of Actions you have remaining out loud to keep from getting confused! You cannot play any other Actions in between playing the Throne Roomed Action twice.
 Card: Torturer
Set: Intrigue Type: Action – Attack
Cost: 5
Text: +3 Cards. Each other player chooses one: he discards 2 cards; or he gains a Curse card, putting it in his hand.
Rules Clarification: Each other player chooses which option to suffer and then suffers it. A player can choose to gain a Curse even when there are no Curses left, in which case he doesn't gain one; and a player can choose to discard 2 cards even if he has no cards in hand or one card in hand (if he has one card, he discards that single card). Gained Curses go to the players' hands rather than their discard piles. If there aren't enough Curses left for everybody, deal them around in turn order starting with the player to your left. When the order matters (such as with very few Curses left), each player makes his decision of which fate to suffer in turn order.

Card: Tournament
Set: Cornucopia
Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: +1 Action. Each player may reveal a Provence from his hand. If you do, discard it and gain a Prize (from the Prize pile) or a Duchy, putting it on top of your deck. If no one else does, +1 Card, +1 Coin.
Rules Clarification: First you get +1 Action. Then each player, including you, may reveal a Province card from his hand. Then, if you revealed a Province, discard that card, and you gain a Prize of your choice, or a Duchy, putting whatever card you took on top of your deck. If there were no cards in your deck, it becomes the only card in your deck. There are five Prizes, set out at the start of the game; see Preparation. You can only take a Prize from the Prize pile. You can take any Prize from the Prize pile; you do not have to take the top one. You can take a Duchy instead, whether or not the Prizes have run out. You can opt to take a Duchy even if the Duchy pile is empty, or a Prize even if no Prizes are left; in these cases you gain nothing. After gaining your card or not, if no other player revealed a Province, you draw a card and get +1 Coin. So this card will play out one of four ways:
1) if you do not reveal a Province and no-one else does either, you will get +1 Action +1 Card +1 Coin;
2) if you reveal a Province and no one else does, you will gain a Prize or a Duchy and draw it, as well as get +1 Action +1 Coin;
3) if you reveal a Province and so does someone else, you will get +1 Action and gain a Prize or a Duchy, which will be on top of your deck;
4) if you do not reveal a Province but someone else does, you will just get +1 Action.
When you gain a Prize, take whichever remaining Prize you want. You can look through the Prizes that players have not gained yet whenever you want.

Card: Trade Route
Set: Prosperity 
Type: Action 
Cost: 3 Text: +1 Buy, + 1 per token on the Trade Route mat. Trash a card from your hand. Setup: Put a token on each Victory card Supply pile. When a card is gained from that pile, move the token to the Trade Route mat.
Rules Clarification: You get an additional Buy to use in your Buy phase. You get + 1 Coin per token on the Trade Route mat. Then you trash a card from your hand. If you have no cards left in hand, you do not trash one. The amount you get from Trade Route is the same as +1 Coin per Victory card pile that a card has been gained from this game. If Victory cards have been gained from outside the Supply piles, for example using the promotional card Black Market, then this does not count those. Put a coin token on each Victory card pile at the start of the game. When a card is gained from a Victory card pile, move its token onto the Trade Route mat. So for example if this game includes the Dominion: Intrigue card Harem, and so far Harem and Duchy have been bought, but no-one has bought (or otherwise gained) Estate or Province or Colony, then Trade Route makes 2 Coins. It does not matter who gained the cards or how they gained them. You do not get any extra money if a pile has had multiple cards gained from it or is empty; all that matters is if at least one card has been gained from it. It does not matter if cards have been returned to a pile, such as with Ambassador from Dominion: Seaside; Trade Route only cares if a card was ever gained from the pile this game. If you are using Black Market and Trade Route is in the Black Market deck, put tokens on Victory card piles at the start of the game.

Card: Trading Post
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: Trash 2 cards from your hand. If you do, gain a Silver card; put it into your hand.
Rules Clarification: If you have 2 or more cards, you must trash exactly 2 cards and gain a Silver card. The gained Silver card goes into your hand and can be spent the same turn. If the Silver pile is empty, you do not gain a Silver card (but still trash cards if possible). If you only have one card left in your hand and you play Trading Post, you trash the one remaining card but you do not gain a Silver. If you have no cards left when you play this, nothing happens.

Card: Transmute
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 1P
Text: Trash a card from your hand. If it is a…  Action card, gain a Duchy. Treasure card, gain a Transmute. Victory card, gain a Gold.
Rules Clarification: If you have no cards left in hand to trash, you do not get anything. If you trash a Curse to this, you do not get anything – Curse is not an Action card or Victory card or Treasure card. If you trash a card with more than one type, you get each applicable thing. For example, if you trash an Action-Victory card (such as Nobles, from Dominion: Intrigue), you gain both a Duchy and a Gold. Gained cards come from the Supply and go to your discard pile. If there are no appropriate cards left to gain, you don't gain those cards.

Card: Treasure Map
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 4
Text: Trash this and another copy of Treasure Map from your hand. If you do trash two Treasure Maps, gain 4 Gold cards, putting them on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: You can play this without another Treasure Map in your hand; if you do, you trash this and gain nothing. You have to actually trash two copies of Treasure Map to gain the Golds; so for example if you Throne Room a Treasure Map, with two more Treasure Maps in hand, then the first time Treasure Map resolves you trash it and another one and gain 4 Golds, and the second time it resolves you trash your other Treasure Map but gain nothing (since you didn't actually trash the played Treasure Map that time). If there aren't enough Gold cards left, just gain what you can. The gained Golds go on top of your Deck. If your deck was empty they become the only cards in it.

Card: Treasury
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 5
Text: +1 Card, +1 Action, +1 Coin. When you discard this from play, if you didn’t buy a Victory card this turn, you may put this on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: If you buy multiple cards and at least one of them is a Victory card, then none of your Treasuries can be put on top of your deck. If you played multiple Treasuries and did not buy a Victory card this turn, then you can put any or all of the played Treasuries on top of your deck. If you forget and discard a Treasury to your discard pile, then essentially you have chosen not to use the optional ability. You may not dig through your discard pile to retrieve it later. Gaining a Victory card without buying it, such as with Smugglers, does not stop you from putting Treasury on top of your deck.

Card: Tribute
Set: Intrigue 
Type: Action 
Cost: 5 
Text: The player to your left reveals and then discards the top 2 cards of his deck. For each different named card revealed, if it an... Action card, +2 Actions, Treasure card, +2 Coins, Victory Card, +2 Cards
Rules Clarification: If the player after you has fewer than 2 cards left in his deck, he reveals all the cards in his deck, shuffles his discard pile (which does not include currently revealed cards), and then reveals the remainder needed. The player then discards the revealed cards. If the player after you does not have enough cards to reveal 2, he reveals what he can. You get bonuses for the types of cards revealed, counting only the different cards. A card with 2 types gives you both bonuses. So if the player to your left reveals Copper and Harem, you get +4 coins and +2 cards; if he reveals 2 Silvers, you just get +2 coins. Curse produces no bonus.

Card: Trusty Steed
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action - Prize
Cost: 0 *
Text:. Choose two: +2 Cards; or +2 Actions; or +2 Coins; or gain 4 Silvers and put your deck into your discard pile.  (This is not in the Supply.)
Rules Clarification: First choose any two of the four options; then do those options in the order listed. So if you choose both +2 Cards, and the last option, you will draw cards before you gain the Silvers and put your deck into your discard pile. The last option both gains you Silvers and puts your deck into your discard pile. The Silvers come from the Supply; if there are fewer than four left, just gain as many as you can. You do not get to look through your deck as you put it into your discard pile.

Card: University
Set: Alchemy
Type: Action Cost: 2+1P
Text: +2 Actions. You may gain an Action card costing up to 5 Coins.
Rules Clarification: Gaining an Action card is optional. If you choose to gain one, it comes from the Supply, must cost no more than 5 Coin, and goes to your discard pile. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action, are Actions and can be gained this way. Cards with Potion in their cost can't be gained by this.

Card: Upgrade
Set: Intrigue Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: +1 Card, +1 Action. Trash a card form your hand. Gain a card costing exactly 1 Coin more than it.
Rules Clarification: Draw a card first. Then, you must trash a card from your hand and gain a card costing exactly 1 coin more than the trashed card. The gained card has to be a card in the Supply, and it goes into your discard pile. If there are no cards available for that cost, you do not get one (you still trashed a card though). If you do not have a card in your hand to trash, you neither trash nor gain a card. Card costs are affected by Bridge. Since Bridge affects the costs of the card you trash and the card you gain, in most cases the Bridge will have no net effect. But since cards cannot go below zero in cost, a Bridge played before an Upgrade would allow you to trash a Copper (cost of zero, even with the Bridge) and gain an Estate (cost of 1 as a result of the Bridge).

Card: Vault
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action Cost: 5 Text: +2 Cards. Discard any number of cards. +1 Coin per card discarded.
Each other player may discard 2 cards. If he does, he draws a card.
Rules Clarification: "Any number" includes zero. You draw cards first; you can discard the cards you just drew. Each other player chooses whether or not to discard 2 cards, then discards 2 cards if he chose to, then draws a card if he did discard 2 cards. If one of the other players has just one card, he can choose to discard it, but will not draw a card. Another player who discards but then has no cards left to draw shuffles in the discards before drawing.

Card: Venture
Set: Prosperity
Type: Treasure Cost: 5 Text: 1 Coin. When you play this, reveal cards from your deck until you reveal a Treasure. Discard the other cards. Play that Treasure.
Rules Clarification: This is a Treasure card worth 1 Coin, like Copper. When you play it, you reveal cards from your deck until revealing a Treasure card. If you run out of cards before revealing a Treasure, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) to get more; if you still do not find a Treasure, just discard all of the revealed cards. If you do find a Treasure, discard the other cards and play the Treasure. If that Treasure does something when played, do that something. For example if Venture finds you another Venture, you reveal cards again. Remember that you choose what order to play Treasure cards; for example if you have both Venture and Loan in hand, you can play either one first.

Card: Village
Set: Basic
Type: Action Cost: 3 Text: +1 Card. +2 Actions
Rules Clarification: If you're playing multiple Villages, keep a careful count of your Actions. Say how many you have left out loud; this trick works every time.

Card: Vineyard
Set: Alchemy
Type: Victory Cost: 1P
Text: Worth 1 VP for every 3 Action cards in your deck (rounded down).
Rules Clarification: This Kingdom card is a Victory card, not an Action card. It does nothing until the end of the game, when it is worth 1 victory point per 3 Action cards in your Deck (counting all of your cards - your Discard pile and hand are part of your Deck at that point). Round down; if you have 11 Action cards, Vineyard is worth 3 victory points. During set-up, put all 12 Vineyards in the Supply for a game with 3 or more players, but only 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action, are Actions and so are counted by Vineyard.

Card: Warehouse
Set: Seaside
Type: Action
Cost: 3
Text: +3 Cards, +1 Action. Discard 3 cards.
Rules Clarification: If you do not have 3 cards to draw in you deck, draw as many as you can, shuffle your discard pile, and draw the remaining cards. If you are still not able to draw 3 cards, draw as many as you can. You will still need to discard 3 cards if you can, even if you couldn’t draw 3. You may discard any combination of cards that you just drew with the Warehouse or cards that were previously in your hand.

Card: Watchtower
Set: Prosperity
Type: Action - Reaction Cost: 3
Text: Draw until you have 6 cards in hand. 
Reaction: When you gain a card, you may reveal this from your hand. If you do, either trash that card, or put it on top of your deck.
Rules Clarification: When you play this, you draw cards one at a time until you have 6 cards in hand. If you have 6 or more cards in hand already, you do not draw any cards. When you gain a card, even on someone else's turn, you may reveal Watchtower from your hand, to either trash the gained card or put it on top of your deck. You may reveal Watchtower each time you gain a card; for example if another player plays Mountebank, you may use Watchtower to trash both the Curse and Copper, or to trash the Curse and put the Copper on top of your deck, or just to trash the Curse, and so on. You still did gain whatever card you gained; you just immediately trash it. So if Mountebank gives you a Curse and you trash it, the Curse pile will go down by one as the Curse gets moved to the trash pile. You may reveal Watchtower on your own turn as well, for example when buying a card, or gaining a card via something like Expand. If you use Watchtower to put a card on your deck but have no cards left in your deck, you do not shuffle; the gained card becomes the only card in your deck. Revealing Watchtower does not take it out of your hand; you could reveal Watchtower on multiple opponents' turns and still have it on your turn to draw up to 6 with. When cards are gained during a Possession turn (from Dominion: Alchemy), the player who played Possession is the one who can use Watchtower, not the player who is being possessed. If a gained card is going somewhere other than to your discard pile, such as a card gained with Mine (from Dominion), you can still use Watchtower to trash it or put it on your deck.

Rules Clarification: First you draw your card. Then name a card ("Copper," for example - not "Treasure") and reveal the top card of your deck; if you named the same card you revealed, put the revealed card in your hand. If you do not name the right card, you put the revealed card back on top.

Card: Witch
Set: Basic 
Type: Action - Attack 
Cost: 5 
Text: +2 Cards. Each other player gains a Curse card.
Rules Clarification: If there aren't enough Curses left to go around when you play the Witch, you deal them out in turn order – starting with the player after you. If you play Witch with no Curses remaining, you will still draw 2 cards. A player gaining a Curse puts it face-up into his Discard pile.

Set: Prosperity

Card: Workshop
Set: Basic Type: Action Cost: 3 Text: Gain a card costing up to 4 Coins.
Rules Clarification: The card you gain is put into your Discard pile. It has to be a card from the Supply. You cannot use coins from Treasures or previous Actions (like the Market) to increase the cost of the card you may gain.

Card: Young Witch
Set: Cornucopia 
Type: Action - Attack
Cost: 4
Text: +2 Cards. Each other player may reveal a Bane card from his hand. If he doesn’t, he gains a Curse.
Set-up: Add an extra Kingdom card pile costing 2 Coins or 3 Coins to the supply. Cards from that pile are Bane cards.
Rules Clarification: This card causes there to be an extra pile in the Supply, called the Bane pile; see Preparation. The extra pile is just like other Kingdom card piles - it can be bought, it can be gained
via cards like Horn of Plenty, it counts for the end game condition. When you play Young Witch, after you draw 2 cards and discard 2 cards, each other player may reveal a Bane card from his hand; if he does not, he gains a Curse. This attack hits other players in turn order, which matters when the Curse pile is low. Players may still respond to a Young Witch with Reaction cards like Horse Traders or Moat (from Dominion); those happen before Bane cards are revealed. If Secret Chamber (from Dominion: Intrigue) is the Bane card, first you can reveal it for its Reaction ability, and then, if it's still in your hand, you can reveal it to avoid getting a Curse.
